            <p id="p04">It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a
                logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>

            <p id="p03">ASCI Code</p>

            <p id="p04">It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand
                numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.

            <p id="p03">RAM (Random Access Memory)</p>

            <p id="p04">It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase
                the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the
                same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>

            <p id="p03">Computer Program</p>

            <p id="p04">A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that
                implement specific algorithms.</p>

            <p id="p03">DNS (Domain Name System)</p>

            <p id="p04">A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to
